"""
why aiohttp over httpx?
    - Our module is fully using asynchronous which is aiohttp spesialization
    - has more mature asyncio support than httpx
    - aiohttp is more suitable for applications that require high concurrency and low latency, such as web scraping or real-time data processing.
